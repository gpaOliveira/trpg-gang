> How did you get so passionate photography?
He got a camera when the family moved to the city, to motivate him (their only child) to record his experience and talk over it (which kind of worked, he talks a lot about his photos). It was also his way to get out of the house (and away from the fights between his parents), often with the excuse to take Ikki to walk. He loves to share his photos with everyone, teachers and kids alike, and has no filter if the person would like to see them or not - in his mind everyone should see the world as he sees it (which hardly ever is the case).

> What have you ignored to pursue this passion?
Learning how schools topics such as language and math can be useful. His grades are not great.
