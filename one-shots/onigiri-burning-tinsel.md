# Onigiri

Stealthy martial-arts meele guy with a Zikov implant (enhanced speed/reflex), walking around with a light load

## Background

Onigiri was supposed to have a good life - corpo parents, living in the executive zone, studying in the academy, nothing to worry. Until some gonks invaded his house and killed his parents. He was found the next morning, hiding in the basement, when Panther Claws (who provided security to his parents) appeared,  coming to check in the situation. Some higher up in the gang decided to adopt him and transferred him to their dojo, where he received his cute name as a reminder that he didn't belong there. Over the years he showed how resilient he could be, but kept the name as a badge of honour. He cut all his hair almost religiously and is always seen (when he wants to) with a black suit and tie and his armor-coated aviators with green lenses.

## Angle

Make them pay - with the money from his infiltration gigs, he hire medias and netrunners to discover why his parents were killed and make sure everyone involved is dead.
