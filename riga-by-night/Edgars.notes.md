# People

Riahrdi/Rigard -> informant broker to the prince, office is in a garage, control the university campus. Nosferatu with the dry skin

Nikita -> guard on the office of Richard

Arran -> thief who run with the vial from Amsterdam

Micha -> enforcer of the Prince, was doing drug dealing in the university campus chemistry department

# Session 1

We were tasked by Rigard (on behalf of the prince) to find a thief. The thief stole an encrusted vial with blood (from who?) from Amsterdam and is hiding in Riga, somewhere in a ship. Edgars met the malkavian who can taste food (add Meghan's character details here).

First we intimidated a gang of drug cookers higing in the chemistry department of the university (the territory of Rigard, he asked us to go there). The gang was tied to Micha.

Edgars spooked the fugitive vampires, that were hidden in the restaurant boat, by telling the truth ("we can help you mister thief to not die a final death, we know about the vial you stole"). The thief was together with 2 more, they ran away in a small boat towards the university island and the night was over.

# Session 2

In the new night we came back to Rigard to find a new member, a doctor named (add Eric's character detail here), that is supposedly a blood expert and should help us tracking the thief.

In the university campus we found a priest (add Frank's character detail here), made into kindred very recently, who was trying very hard to get killed by breaking the Masquereade. We found no trace on the fugitive vampires near their boat, but a vision showed a struggle between them.

Without many options we came back to Rigard, who told us to call Anastasia.

Anastasia made us go to her warehouse in the docks. Her office is a big open space with shelves and her table. She is verry huge (bodybuilder huge) and has a big infernal dog.

When we told her about the thief she told us to politely leave (in her own way) and proceeded to call someone and say "do it". A warehouse nearby suddenly became on fire, acident?

Some car left the scene. After a small car chase, a guy jumped out and run away. While investigating the scene, Edgars got a compulsion to keep investigating forever and kinda ignored the guy in the trees that was looking at him but run away.
