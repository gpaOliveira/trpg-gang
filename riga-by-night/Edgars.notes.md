# People

Riahrdi/Rigard -> informant broker to the prince, office is in a garage, control the university campus. Nosferatu with the dry skin

Nikita -> guard on the office of Richard, human.

Arran -> thief who run with the vial from Amsterdam

Micha -> enforcer of the Prince, was doing drug dealing in the university campus chemistry department

Vial of blood came from the Amsterdam Prince.

# Session 1

We were tasked by Rigard (on behalf of the prince) to find a thief. The thief stole an encrusted vial with blood (from who?) from Amsterdam and is hiding in Riga, somewhere in a ship. Edgars met the malkavian who can taste food (add Meghan's character details here).

First we intimidated a gang of drug cookers higing in the chemistry department of the university (the territory of Rigard, he asked us to go there). The gang was tied to Micha.

Edgars spooked the fugitive vampires, that were hidden in the restaurant boat, by telling the truth ("we can help you mister thief to not die a final death, we know about the vial you stole"). The thief was together with 2 more, they ran away in a small boat towards the university island and the night was over.

# Session 2

In the new night we came back to Rigard to find a new member, a doctor named (Felix), that is supposedly a blood expert and should help us tracking the thief.

In the university campus we found a priest (James), made into kindred very recently, who was trying very hard to get killed by breaking the Masquereade. We found no trace on the fugitive vampires near their boat, but a vision showed a struggle between them.

Without many options we came back to Rigard, who told us to call Anastasia.

Anastasia made us go to her warehouse in the docks. Her office is a big open space with shelves and her table. She is verry huge (bodybuilder huge) and has a big infernal dog.

When we told her about the thief she told us to politely leave (in her own way) and proceeded to call someone and say "do it". A warehouse nearby suddenly became on fire, acident?

Some car left the scene. After a small car chase, a guy jumped out and run away. While investigating the scene, Edgars got a compulsion to keep investigating forever and kinda ignored the guy in the trees that was looking at him but run away.

In the middle of my very important investigation, I fail to notice a guy mumbling something about an artifact. Suddenly I see it - the vial is there! And the guy also saw it, and me! I attack him as a wild animal with my bare hands and rush to pick the vial, but there he is again. During our struggle I pick the vial and he smashes my hand and suddenly blood and glass are in my hands. Suddenly the world of Riga as I know it is on flames - the university, the cafe in the corner, everything. But I don't panic. People I know are fighting in the streets among the flames - Anastasia, Rigard, some others from the last Elysium. Suddenly when I flash my eyes they are all crucified. Others in monk outfits, wearing religious Sabbat robes, have crucified them.

One of the priests, a middle eastern guy, pull his showl and says: "You think you're blamelles, you think you can escape, you think you can teach the cattle" then I see myself in a cross, and put on fire. Estigmata flaw acquired! Hungry as never before I find a bar with a drunk homeless person that was in the wrong place in the right time. After drinking him dry, I take his wallet and realise a photo of his two little girls - something for tomorrow. I got a call from Nikita, good guy, but I can't deal with it right now, I'm going home. Tomorrow I talk to Rigard.

I call one of the book club members, Eric, a retired cop with a flair for misteries and a collection of Agatha Cristie books. I ask him for help to identify the person I killed (ofc I didn't say that! I just found a random drunk person dead on the street and decided to do something about it) - for which I took the wallet with his driver's license. Then I checked in with Dr Felix and Audrey and made sure they meet me in Rigard later.

Later on Rigard, I explain the situation with the vial and he advises us to keep it to ourselves - he doesn't believe the Prince would be interested in such non-sense visions, which I respect. With the search finished, he handed me a printout of a blog post, with the photo of Audrey and I coming out and a sensacionalist head-line. Although he agrees the blog post doesn't post a immediate threat, he thinks we should do something to mitigate future problems.

I also catch up to Audrey and she told me Anastasia said something about artifacts in the warehouse to a minion. Anastasia came back with Audrey to her office to see 3 bodies with many cuts and no blood and a monk in the sofa. The monk speaks briefly with Anastasia "this seems like a bad time" and leaves and Anastasia seems unsettled by him. Felix stayed behind to check what happened to start the fire. He finds an open container with a bedrool and refrigerator and books around but can't explain how the fire was started.

After coming back home, happily-distracted by a difficult chess game with Jeremiah, Edgars mind relax and reflect on all that happened.

He decides to call his sire (Dominik) to peek his interest on the vision he had. He tell Dominik: "I and my friends from work got together to go into a hunt for treasures around Riga (organised by one of our bosses from Amsterdam), and after that, I got the strangest dream related to our common distant family members. Will tell you all about it in details in your next visit. When are planning to stop by Riga again? Or shall I be the one visiting you in Prague, like old times".

Also, to handle the blogger/photo situation, he calls Audrey to share an idea. Edgars volunteers to organise a dinner-for-poor, with some newspapers photographers invited and all, so that Audrey is seen cooking and he is seen handing over food to the poor. This will help to get them some positive PR and distance them from any unfounded rumours about blood magic. He may know a NPO or two tied to churches in Riga that would be willing to help them, if she agrees.

Finally, he spends more time in the next days checking his personal library (in the haven) and also calling other city libraries. He starts to collect any piece of information about end of the world predictions involving Riga over the centuries.

A couple days later, he calls Eric again (a retired cop, and member of his "book club", with a flair for misteries and a collection of Agatha Cristie books) to check in on his request to identify the person he "found" dead on the street.

# Session 3

- James (Frankie)
- Felix (Eric)
- Yoji (Gaspar)
- Gaspar (Andrei, sire of Audrey)

Last night we were called to report to Misha our progress on the vial hunt (apparently Rigard answers to him). I was busy plotting with Nikita a way to handle the blogger issue - the best idea so far is to feed her a better story, so Rigard will be called to provide an enemy to target and information we can leak to the blogger (an american named Sarah). Audrey is away handling her human input, Emily; James got fed blood bags by Nikita; and Dr Felix learned the hospital have a new middle-eastern investor - the same monk that visited Anastasia. Also, Gaspar joined us, a posh Westerner that apparently is admired by Audrey's sire.

Before going to Misha's place, Nikita lead us to an airfield where a bunch of cars were doing illegal runs. In such GTA inspired setting, we were lead by Nikita to a gundealer mortal, who offered Felix some guns from a trunk. A revolver is bought for $200.

We then finally proceed to Misha place, in a hippie area in the center of the city near the central-market. In a gym, awfully crowded at this time at night, we found Russian minions and Misha's office.

By talking about the vial to Misha, the Prince enforcer (who carries a large crucifix, so James liked him right away), we learned the blood hunt is still on as the thief is still in the wild. We also got to know that the harbors have been closed for weeks now, more than one warehouse exploded, and thus the Prince is not happy with Anastasia due to such undesired attention. We got interrupted by a minion reporting that some other Misha's gym was attacked, maybe by Anastasia people (we just heard they were buffed people).

We come back to the university to look for clues on what could be explosives, to have proof they were being built by Misha's man in some kind of plan to undermine Anastasia - however, Nikita have already told Anastasia about such suspicion when he came to fetch Audrey and James and Felix the other night, hence why Anastasia now may be attacking Misha's gyms. In any case Dr Felix was very useful to lockpick and to recognise the chemicals that were there as being indeed used in explosives, but a component was missing (one he couldn't quite guess).

With such war raving in the streets, we've used the rest of the night to brainstorm ways forward - none was put together or chosen so far. Shall we go to Anastasia, empty handed with nothing to offer, and offer our services and expose Misha? Shall we investigate the other bruned warehouses in search for more clues to offer Anastasia? Or shall we listen to the suggestion of the French musician that just joined us?
