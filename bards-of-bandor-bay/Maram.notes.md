Dear friend,

I've been gone for a long while but a recent near-death experience made me reflect on why I stopped writing to you. The last time if I recall correctly was years ago, since we split after leaving the Mithrandras' family manor. This will therefore be a long one. I'm whole heartedealy hoping this letter will find you well, even after the ugly words we exchanged so many years ago.

As a gesture of good faith I'll tell you what I'm up to - please do write back telling me about recent developments on your private life as well if you also desire to rekindle our relationship.

I'm in a confusing time that, as all confusing times, started inocently enough - a business opportunity. Getting involved with Orcish whiskey seemed like a good way to get into my dear father good graces again after that little mischief we came up to in the temple. I still don't quite understand why he blamed us for it as we were just in the wrong place. Yes the place blew up but we managed to save the people! And the place was ancient anyway, renovations were in order. But, alas, I digress. The whiskey is becoming quite popular among the ostentatious Elf lords my father calls friends, so you can see how it became an annoyance to the wine making family I "unfortunately belong to" (yes I'm repeating his words now, I'm getting old I think). Anyway, when I heard that the orcish whiskey was coming from a small city called Mithline [1], I travelled there with the intention of learning more about it - either to disrupt the operation or to help it grow as a middle finger to the family ofc. Simple enough right!? Or so I thought...

I find a lot more than orcish whiskey in that town, let me tell you my dear friend. The most unusual group of entertainers you'd have seen was there: a half-human, like us, afraid of water (that wants to burn the oceans!), a pirate named Desireo who lost his ship (how come one lose a ship right?! It's soo big...), and a politician named Jack Hawthorne from a town that I couldn't bother pronouncing as I'll surely got it wrong (my elvish mispelling lessons trauma all over again!). Apparently all those are also interested, somehow, in the orcish whiskey operation. Mixed with the barrels of whiskey there was some strange swamp plants as well. We discovered the name of ship that should carry some of the barrels somewhere else and their departure time. Before long a commotion in a wedding attracted our attention and there we went to find pixies charmed boars in wheels! What a sight to behold! As you can imagine I couldn't resist not helping the people to survive the certain carnage that was being developed and, with that weird group of people, we managed to restore the tavern to a state where a significantly distracted observer might be fooled into thinking the disarray had been caused by an ordinary tavern brawl. Sucess! And got some money also, by performing my newly unusual instruments (yes I keep inventing new ones every day!)

Funny fact, after my dazzling performance, an old but sprightly man dressed in flowy silver silken robes approached, certainly to bask on my presence. He also had thick gray mustache and a silvery beard reaching to his waist. He handed me a leather folder, with a title page in three distinctly different scripts and  thick stack of parchments [2].
The sheet music itself is perfectly readable, but the letters making up the script and libretto keep moving around when I tried to read them. The man said: "This is a musical theatre piece that I wish for you to perform for the Noble Houses of the Verdant Realm. When you are ready. You will not be able to read it until you play the music with the right instruments.". Which is odd, who does that? Very intriguing... so I realised the pages had schematics for instruments of the most fanciful designs, made out of the most fanciful materials: A pan flute bound with hair from an Archfey, a violin made out of Infernal Steel, a xylophone made from the teeth of a Black Dragon, and you don't even understand what some of the other instruments are supposed to be. Before I could finish saying where he could shove all that nonsense, the man was gone, puft, gone out of thin air as if he never had existed. I almost put the parchments in the compartment for trash but then the though hit me: playing for the nobles in the Verdant Realm could bring possible useful alliances. And honestly, how come I could reject the challenge to find such exquisite instruments? The entertainers I just met would be perfect to the job! So, I wrote down some letters to some people about such a list of instruments (yes I can see the irony on how I wrote to them but not you) and went on my merry way looking for a place to supper. In there I met a musketeer in the service of the duchess of Toussaint, who introduced himself as Pierre. What an issuferable good-doer that one is... but surprinsignly he had a violin made out of Infernal Iron! The first instrument have been found and the page for it stopped shifting when I looked at it again [2]! We exchanged contacts and notes and I told him about the whole ordeal and I think he will be part of the band (fingers crossed).

With that I told him my farewell and went on my main business - to find passage into a ship that would follow the one carrying orcish whiskey load to the town of Redport. At Redport, the shipment was mixed with other goods, stamped with a certain symbol, and moved to smaller vessels, for transport upriver. Regarding, the instruments, my contacts came through with some information (would you have written me back if I had asked you, dead friend?). Apparently there is an Archfey, or possibly several, living in the Veiled forest, and such entities are powerful, and can be dangerous to deal with (apparently we shouldn't tell them our names or eat the food they offer as well). The Infernal Steel violin was confirmed to be with the goodfella Pierre, as I discovered. Getting Black Dragon teeth may be difficult, but I gathered that Black Dragons tend to live in swamps and there is a dragon expert in the League of Illumination (that group of humans inventors that my father often complained about) that may be worth visiting [3].

Without further leads I did what I do best: performed somewhere and got some local gossips! I'll save the one about the local barkeeper for a later letter because the important one is about something more valuable than Orcish whisky, and even more valuable than the swamp plants. Nobody managed to tell me what exactly, but it was being smuggled in certain shipments from V'ael proper. To continue my investigation of the smuggling operation (and also because of needing to procure hair from an Archfey), I returned to V'ael (in the elven village of Sinshari), where I found Dagmar and Pierre again, what are the odds right [4]?! Something bigger than us what at play here, with people and pixies dissapearing along the notoriously treacherous foggy road from the Verdant Realm to V'ael. Because of that, I put the smuggling search on hold and decided to follow them for a bit.

We were tasked to escort Wally Gigglewhiskers through the fey foggy road, somewhere. Along the way, Pierre told me about this Disco dimension they found and Dagmar filled me in the details of their dealings with its owner, a dragon named Chad [5]. It's an interesting place I must say, very chill, the type of place you'd appreciate dear friend (unless you changed much in the years we've been apart). Only problem is how visiting such dimension leaves our material plane body behind - small price to pay for some fun and booze I think. After surviving a crazy goblin wizard in the road, we found our destination: a surprising manor in the middle of the spooky V'ael forest [6].

The manor owner was named Aelarion Starwind and along with him there were several members of the League of Illumination [7]. As I told you already, my lovely father, who already thinks humans are children, particularly dislike the ones in the League of Illumination, considering them naive, taking too many risks by meddling with things that ought not be meddled with, looking for dangerous artifacts, or developing new spells. For me, the fellas are sympathetic enough, even though they want to take Dagmar in and help her boil the oceans (what a terrible future await us if they suceed).

We were asked to spend the night there and were lead to some rooms we could sleep in - Dagmar managed to be attacked even in such a safe place! How does she do that I wonder... I got there too late and only found dead vampire pixies around her now destroyed room. The dead pixies were all put in a safe locked box, one of my best work of creation I must say. During dinner I asked the cartographer Carter about the fanciful materials for fanciful instruments I'm looking for but he didn't know much more than I already did - he may not be such an expert at all. I still didn't find a dragon expert though, will have to keep looking.

To pay for our stay we agreed to get rid of a "rat" infestation in the basement. I should have suspected that no one puts a magic barrier to contain a rat infestation - I guess travelling with those folks have gotten me rusty. We found a lot more than rats there - ooze-based monsters and lots-of-eyes-monsters. While my scouting skills were useful to the group, you know my dear friend I'm not found of violent endeavors and I must say the enemies overwhelmed me. My life was saved by Dagmar, who is particularly good with violence (may the gods protect the oceans!). When I woke up again, Pierre told me a great inspiring tale of how he hold the door and killed many monsters - he named it Hodor and laughed about it as if it was an old joke. Such tale comforted my heart and inspired me to write to you dear friend. I guess almost dying brings old wounds and mistakes back to life.

I miss our conversations dear friend and, as I said before, please do write back if you also share such feelings. May the stars shine upon our future meeting moment, your forever friend, Maram.
